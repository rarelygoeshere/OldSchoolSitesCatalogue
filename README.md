# OldSchoolSitesCatalogue
A list of all the old-school sites I can find. Websites fitting into this umbrella tend to be lightweight and have aesthetics reminiscent of Web 1.0. The sites do not necessarily have to be old to be included.

There aren't many restrictions or limitations on adding more sites to this list, so feel free to make a pull request and contribute.
